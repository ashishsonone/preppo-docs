Concern: do we need another table to store quiz details. How we will know at client side which quizzes are available as list.
  
  Quiz : store meta data about quiz
  QuizQuestions : store question content

  Use Quiz table to fetch list of quizzes.
  Then when enter a quiz, fetch all of its questions

Option 1:
  Quiz will just store the 
    type of quiz : weekly, daily, monthly
    its id
    publishDate
    admin stuff

  QuizQuestion will contain:
    actual content
    level
    quizId or quizIds (foreign key to Quiz)
    admin stuff
    NO : publishDate (X)

  Work ?
    fetch recent quiz list by publishDate
    To get questions for a quiz, use its quizId to query QuizQuestion to fetch all questions with quizId = <quizId>

  Pros/Cons
    (+) Since questions indexed by quizId, it will be a scan of the quizId index and then documents will be retrieved in one pass
    (-) question's reusability is reduced since question should be independent of the quiz
    (+) deleting/publishing/unpublishing a question is easy just 1 update query => And it will also automatically affect the Quiz itself. So any question can be taken down immediately

Option 2:
  Quiz will store:
    type : weekly, daily, monthly
    its id
    publishDate
    admin stuff
    questionIds -> array : this will be used to fetch the questions for this quiz

  QuizQuestion will store:
    actual content
    level
    admin stuff
    NO : publishDate(X) or quizId (X)

  Work ?
    fetch recent quiz list by publishDate
    To get questions for a quiz, the list of quizIds to get the questions by using 
      {_id : {'$in' : questionIds }}

  Pros/Cons
    (+) Independed question bank. Can be reused a number of times since only content is stored in QuizQuestion. No other stuff
    (-) Fetching questions will be N searches in the index of QuizQuestion
    (-) deleting/publishing/unpublishing a question means removing it from all the quizzes which contain it also
    (+) once questions are created, creating a new quiz is straightforward - pick question - but how will the questions be picked
