===========
create a ssl certificate
reference https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/ssl-certificates
-----------

create folder to store your certificate
  mkdir ssl_cert
  cd ssl_cert/

generate a new private key
  openssl genrsa -out lb.key 2048

To generate a signed certificate, you will need a certificate signing request (CSR). Run the following command to create one: (it will ask for some information about company, etc)
  openssl req -new -key lb.key -out lb.csr

You can use your new CSR to obtain a valid certificate from a certificate authority. Alternatively, you can generate a self-signed certificate by running the following:
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in lb.csr -signkey lb.key -out lb.crt

=============
Create an SslCertificate resource
-------------
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create lb-dummy-certificate --certificate lb.crt --private-key lb.key

=============
common gcloud operations corresponding to ssl certificate
-------------

gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe SSL_CERTIFICATE_NAME

gcloud compute ssl-certificates list

gcloud compute ssl-certificates delete SSL_CERTIFICATE

=============
using it in LB
-------------
use it while creating a global forwarding rule inside http load balancer :
  select protocol as HTTPS, 
  and pick the certificate using its name (here as create above : 'lb-dummy-certificate')

============
after setting backend service, host & path rules, health check :
once all set access the endpoint
