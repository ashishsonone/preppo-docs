Once we have our backend node instance up and running independently, we need to create an instance group which can be used in load balancer's backend service.

Note : remember to set http port as 8002 in instance group configuration
---------

Create instance group
  'dev-node-group'
  Use existing instances : dev-node-1, dev-node-2 to add to the group

Now edit the instance group configuration:
  Click on : Specify port name mapping
    create port name mapping "http : 8002"

--------
Create a health check
  name : 'basic-health-check'
  protocol : http
  port : 8002
  path : /health
Leave rest to defaults

--------
Create a load balancer
  name : dev-load-balancer

Obtain(from godaddy) or Create a self-signed ssl certificate as given in ssl_certificate_gce.txt
  create ssl certificate resource on Google Cloud using gcloud command

Add a global forwarding rule
  name : dev-api-preppo
  ip : as ephemeral (for development), choose static ip for production
  use : HTTPS, 443,
  choose the ssl resource just created above

Create a backend service
  name : <default>
  protocol : http
  port-name : http (which in our instance group maps to 8002 - yay)
  timeout : 20 seconds
  for the backend:
    select the instance group created earlier
    leave everything else to default
  for health-check:
    select 'basic-health-check' which hits on 8002 port (verify this)

Create Host and path rules
  Leave it to default settings, i.e any unmatched requests should go to above backend service
  save

Now Load Balancer should show 2 (or whatever number of) healthy instances.
We're done
