conventions:
    machine(and hence boot disk) names : dev-mongo-1
    db disk names : dev-mongo-1-data
    boot image names : mongo-boot-image-v1 (no 'dev' prefix as it is to be used by everyone)
    db snapshot names : dev-mongo-1-data-snapshot-v1 (db disk name as prefix)

    For production : use 'prod-' prefix everywhere instead of 'dev-'

mongodb checklist:
    + ulimit -n
    + disable transparent hugepages
    + use ssds
    swap enable *
    + seperate logs and data/journal into different storage

steps for mongodb setup:
    create ubuntu 14.04 VM with 10 GB boot disk (with unchecked delete disk on instance deletion)
    VM name : dev-mongo-1 (auto set by GCE boot disk name : dev-mongo-1)
    Install and setup mongodb with supervisor, mongodb user and above checklist
    Create another disk (SSD) for data : 'dev-mongo-1-data' - 50 GB
    attach it to 'dev-mongo', format it
    Mount it at '/mongo' . 
    Configure supervisor mongodb init script to use /mongo/db as dbpath

Create mongo boot image:
    Check mongodb is working
    create a dummy database, insert some values.
    Now delete the instance 'dev-mongo'.
    Create image from boot disk 'dev-mongo-1'
    Image name : 'mongo-boot-image'
    Delete 'dev-mongo-1' disk
    Now we have just image 'mongo-boot-image' and data disk 'dev-mongo-1-data-disk
    
Use image:
    Create VM with 'mongo-boot-image'
    attach & mount the disk 'dev-mongo-1-data-disk' @ '/mongo' (DONOT format)
    See if everything works as expected

-------------------
    Try mongodb data disk snapshots using fsync and temporarily stopping the write to disk

-------------------
    Node server see how config will be stored, git ignored
    Whether to use different branches or different repos for development and production
